**The self-improving AI agent rebranded for Meridian Digital.** It has a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, searches its own past conversations, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure that costs nearly nothing when idle. It's not tied to your laptop — talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM.

Use any model you want — [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (200+ models), [NovitaAI](https://novita.ai) (AI-native cloud for Model API, Agent Sandbox, and GPU Cloud), [NVIDIA NIM](https://build.nvidia.com) (Nemotron), [Xiaomi MiMo](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com), [z.ai/GLM](https://z.ai), [Kimi/Moonshot](https://platform.moonshot.ai), [MiniMax](https://www.minimax.io), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), OpenAI, or your own endpoint. Switch with `meridian model` — no code changes, no lock-in.

## Quick Install

### Linux, macOS, WSL2, Termux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hermes-agent/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (native, PowerShell) — Early Beta

> **Heads up:** Native Windows support is **early beta**. It installs and runs, but hasn't been road-tested as broadly as our Linux/macOS/WSL2 paths. Please [file issues](https://github.com/hermes-agent/hermes-agent/issues) when you hit rough edges. For the most battle-tested Windows setup today, run the Linux/macOS one-liner above inside **WSL2**.

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hermes-agent/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.ps1)
```

The installer handles everything: uv, Python 3.11, Node.js, ripgrep, ffmpeg, **and a portable Git Bash** (MinGit, unpacked to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\git` — no admin required, completely isolated from any system Git install).  Meridian uses this bundled Git Bash to run shell commands.

If you already have Git installed, the installer detects it and uses that instead.  Otherwise a ~45MB MinGit download is all you need — it won't touch or interfere with any system Git.

> **Android / Termux:** The tested manual path is documented in the [Termux guide](https://meridian-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/termux). On Termux, Meridian installs a curated `.[termux]` extra because the full `.[all]` extra currently pulls Android-incompatible voice dependencies.
>
> **Windows:** Native Windows is supported as an **early beta** — the PowerShell one-liner above installs everything, but expect rough edges and please file issues when you hit them. If you'd rather use WSL2 (our most battle-tested Windows path), the Linux command works there too. Native Windows install lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`; WSL2 installs under `~/.hermes` as on Linux.  The only Meridian feature that currently needs WSL2 specifically is the browser-based dashboard chat pane (it uses a POSIX PTY — classic CLI and gateway both run natively).

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # reload shell (or: source ~/.zshrc)
meridian            # start chatting!
```

## Getting Started

```bash
meridian            # Interactive CLI — start a conversation
meridian model        # Choose your LLM provider and model
meridian tools        # Configure which tools are enabled
meridian config set   # Set individual config values
meridian gateway      # Start the messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
meridian setup        # Run the full setup wizard (configures everything at once)
meridian claw migrate # Migrate from OpenClaw (if coming from OpenClaw)
meridian update       # Update to the latest version
meridian doctor       # Diagnose any issues
```

## Skip the API-key collection — Nous Portal

Meridian works with whatever provider you want — that's not changing. But if you'd rather not collect five separate API keys for the model, web search, image generation, TTS, and a cloud browser, **[Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com)** covers all of them under one subscription:

- **300+ models** — pick any of them with `/model <name>`
- **Tool Gateway** — web search (Firecrawl), image generation (FAL), text-to-speech (OpenAI), cloud browser (Browser Use), all routed through your sub. No extra accounts.

One command from a fresh install:

```bash
meridian setup --portal
```

That logs you in via OAuth, sets Nous as your provider, and turns on the Tool Gateway. Check what's wired up any time with `meridian portal status`. Full details on the [Tool Gateway docs page](https://meridian-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/tool-gateway).

You can still bring your own keys per-tool whenever you want — the gateway is per-backend, not all-or-nothing.

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Meridian has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `meridian`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Action | CLI | Messaging platforms |
|---------|-----|---------------------|
| Start chatting | `meridian` | Run `meridian gateway setup` + `meridian gateway start`, then send the bot a message |
| Start fresh conversation | `/new` or `/reset` | `/new` or `/reset` |
| Change model | `/model [provider:model]` | `/model [provider:model]` |
| Set a personality | `/personality [name]` | `/personality [name]` |
| Retry or undo the last turn | `/retry`, `/undo` | `/retry`, `/undo` |
| Compress context / check usage | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [--days N]` | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [days]` |
| Browse skills | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>` | `/<skill-name>` |
| Interrupt current work | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message | `/stop` or send a new message |
| Platform-specific status | `/platforms` | `/status`, `/sethome` |

For the full command lists, see the [CLI guide](https://meridian-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli) and the [Messaging Gateway guide](https://meridian-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging).

## Migrating from OpenClaw

If you're coming from OpenClaw, Meridian can automatically import your settings, memories, skills, and API keys.

**During first-time setup:** The setup wizard (`meridian setup`) automatically detects `~/.openclaw` and offers to migrate before configuration begins.

**Anytime after install:**

```bash
meridian claw migrate              # Interactive migration (full preset)
meridian claw migrate --dry-run    # Preview what would be migrated
meridian claw migrate --preset user-data   # Migrate without secrets
meridian claw migrate --overwrite  # Overwrite existing conflicts
```

What gets imported:
- **SOUL.md** — persona file
- **Memories** — MEMORY.md and USER.md entries
- **Skills** — user-created skills → `~/.hermes/skills/openclaw-imports/`
- **Command allowlist** — approval patterns
- **Messaging settings** — platform configs, allowed users, working directory
- **API keys** — allowlisted secrets (Telegram, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs)
- **TTS assets** — workspace audio files
- **Workspace instructions** — AGENTS.md (with `--workspace-target`)

See `meridian claw migrate --help` for all options, or use the `openclaw-migration` skill for an interactive agent-guided migration with dry-run previews.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! See the [Contributing Guide](https://meridian-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/developer-guide/contributing) for development setup, code style, and PR process.

Quick start for contributors — clone and go with `setup-hermes.sh`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hermes-agent/hermes-agent.git
cd hermes-agent
./setup-hermes.sh     # installs uv, creates venv, installs .[all], symlinks ~/.local/bin/meridian
./meridian            # auto-detects the venv, no need to `source` first
```

Manual path (equivalent to the above):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv .venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
scripts/run_tests.sh
```
